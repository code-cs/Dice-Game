# Dice-Game
Simple dice game using JavaScript and DOM.
The game has two players. Using a random number generator between 1 to 6, which player gets more numbers wins the game,
but if they get the same numbers they draw.
For images also I have used the random image generator to get random images of the dices for the game.
Every time user refreshes the page the dices will change to and depending on the numbers one of the players win or draw the game.
